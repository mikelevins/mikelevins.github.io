Jaemon was a captain in the Jovian Diplomatic Guard, a military
policeman stationed at the Jovian Consular Estate on Mars, when his
father's unexpected death led him to take an early retirement so that
he could return home to Callisto to help his brother Esgar take over
running the family shipping company.
