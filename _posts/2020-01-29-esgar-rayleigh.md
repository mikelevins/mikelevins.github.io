CEO of Rayleigh Scientific, Captain of the torch ship _Kestrel_

Esgar Rayleigh, along with his brother Jaemon, inherited majority
ownership of Rayleigh Company, an old and prestigious shipping firm
that was driven nearly to bankruptcy by his father. He and Jaemon
liquidated most of the firm's assets and laid off most of its
employees in a desperate bid to save the company. A fortunate meeting
with a wealthy scientist named Constantine Yaug led to a life-saving
investment that funded the transformation of Rayleigh Company into
Rayleigh Scientific, a company that provides mobile scientific
transport and support services throughout the solar system.

Esgar and several of his crew are Jovians whose embodiments reflect
traditional aesthetics of the old families of Jupiter's moons. Those
families' predilection for tall, slim body types, pointed ears, and
monochromatic skin tones means that other inhabitants of the solar
system often refer to them—perhaps jokingly—as "elves."
