      <description>Living is sailing.
When you sail, you are borne here and there by vast forces that are outside your control. You&amp;rsquo;re carried by the sea, propelled by the wind, and guided by the sun and stars. None of these elements of nature pay the slightest attention to your wishes.
The wind and sea may at any moment turn against you. They may swamp you or dash you against an unfamiliar shore.</description>

      <title>Against despair</title>

      <description>Despair is a pernicious kind of vanity, and it&amp;rsquo;s seductive when things get hard.
Despair tells you a story like this: &amp;ldquo;I have tried everything and it hasn&amp;rsquo;t worked. I may as well give up.&amp;rdquo;
This story is a lie.
When despair tells you &amp;ldquo;it hasn&amp;rsquo;t worked,&amp;rdquo; it means that we have falsely assumed that the world owes us a particular outcome for our labors. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t. The world promises one thing: the world itself.</description>

      <title>Amor Fati</title>

      <description>Amor fati is a Latin phrase that means &amp;ldquo;love of fate.&amp;rdquo; It&amp;rsquo;s a concept of virtue that we inherit from the ancient Stoics, though we can probably thank Friedrich Nietzsche for the Latin phrase and for its presence in modern discussion1.
The idea isn&amp;rsquo;t original with Nietzsche. It appears in the writings of Marcus Aurelius2—though not in so many words—and in Epictetus3before him.
It&amp;rsquo;s not obvious at first glance what it&amp;rsquo;s supposed to mean.</description>
