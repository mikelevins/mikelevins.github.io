      <description>Ixion 11 &amp;ldquo;Lev&amp;rdquo; Chrysotile is the ship&amp;rsquo;s physician aboard Kestrel. He&amp;rsquo;s the narrator of the first several Kestrel stories.
Lev is a mechâ€”that is, an autonomous, self-aware robot. (Such persons are not referred to as &amp;ldquo;robots&amp;rdquo; in the setting; the word is considered a slur.) He is a Leslie Model 11 specialized for medical field maintenance on biological and mech persons.
He&amp;rsquo;s about twelve years old at the beginning of the Kestrel stories, but, like most autonomous mechs, Leslie Model 11 s roll out of the factory fully mature and prepared to take care of themselves.</description>

      <description>Ordinary Spacer Mai Greenhill, a member of the crew in the Kestrel Chronicles stories.
Captain Esgar Rayleigh recruited Mai from the Greenhill clan of Canines who live in the Greater Asgard Wildlife Preserve system on Callisto. Several companies in the Greater Asgard region recruit crew from Canine clans, but Mai is the first one recruited by Rayleigh Company.</description>

      <title>Book Three Incoming</title>

      <description>Here&amp;rsquo;s a sneak peek at the cover for the book I&amp;rsquo;m working on now:
As the subtitle says, it&amp;rsquo;s the third book about the torch ship Kestrel and her crew. This time the story is less about old damaged ships on the edge of the solar system, and more about crime and punishment in the big (orbital) city.
It took me seven years to write my first unpublished book about this far-future world.</description>

      <description>Esgar Rayleigh is Kestrel&amp;rsquo;s captain. You know this has to be a formal portrait because you don&amp;rsquo;t see a cup of coffee in his hand.</description>

      <description>This is Evelyn Burrell, the chief engineer aboard Kestrel:
I always do a lot of sketching and cartooning when I&amp;rsquo;m working. I don&amp;rsquo;t always share the drawings, but I don&amp;rsquo;t see why I shouldn&amp;rsquo;t.</description>
