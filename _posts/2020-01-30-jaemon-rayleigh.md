Jaemon was a captain in the Jovian Diplomatic Guard, a military
policeman stationed at the Jovian Consular Estate on Mars, when his
father's unexpected death led him to take an early retirement so that
he could return home to Callisto to help his brother Esgar take over
running the family shipping company.

The pointed ears shared by the Rayleighs and Chief Engineer Burrell
are a common feature of many of the old Jovian propertied class, along
with a preference for tallness, slimness, and pale pastel skin
tones. It's these characterisstics that lead natives of some other
worlds to refer to Jovians as "elves".
