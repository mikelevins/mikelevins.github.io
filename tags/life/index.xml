      <description>Art is one of the oldest things that humans do. A handful of carvings have been found in a few different places that are somewhere between half a million and three quarters of a million years old, probably older than Homo sapiens.
Art is older than writing or architecture or agriculture. It&amp;rsquo;s older than most kinds of tools. It might be older than fire; history.com claims that the oldest &amp;ldquo;unequivocal&amp;rdquo; evidence of human control of fire is about 400,000 years old.</description>
