						<h1><a href="http://mikelevins.github.io/posts/2020-07-09-on-sailing/">On sailing</a></h1>
						<span>Jul 9, 2020</span>
					</div>

					<p>Living is sailing.</p>
<p>When you sail, you are borne here and there by vast forces that are
outside your control. You&rsquo;re carried by the sea, propelled by the
wind, and guided by the sun and stars. None of these elements of
nature pay the slightest attention to your wishes.</p>
<p>The wind and sea may at any moment turn against you. They may swamp
you or dash you against an unfamiliar shore. They may bear you far off
course and maroon you some place far from everything you know. If you
sail long enough, you can be sure that eventually the sea will take
you.</p>
<p>Still, you can become a skillful and accomplished sailor if you&rsquo;re
wise and patient. If you don&rsquo;t waste your effort trying to control the
wind and waves, but instead learn them, if you practice riding out
their tantrums and working with them rather than against them, then
you can learn to sail anywhere you want to go.</p>
<p>Often you won&rsquo;t follow exactly the route you planned, because the wind
and the waves will have something to say about it. Maybe you won&rsquo;t
arrive on time. Still, people can and do sail all over the world. Some
have sailed right around it.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t tell the sun how hot to be, or the waves how steep, or the
wind how stiff. You can&rsquo;t command shores not to crush your boat.</p>
<p>But you can learn how to read the sea and how to navigate. You can
learn how to care for your vessel, how to keep it shipshape, when to
put in to port, how to prepare for a stiff blow. You can learn to keep
it properly stocked and in good repair so that it gives you the best
possible chance to ride out rough weather.</p>
<p>My life is a small vessel in a vast ocean. It&rsquo;s at the mercy of
immense forces, but I can still work on it every day. I can batten
down the hatches, replenish the stocks, swab the decks. I can study
the charts, watch the weather, and trust the wind and waves to do what
the wind and waves always do. I can keep an eye on the sun and stars
and practice my skill with sail and tiller.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;l get blown off course. I&rsquo;ll take wrong turns. I&rsquo;ll discover things
I can&rsquo;t do, and there will be places I never make it to before the sea
takes me. But there are also many things I can do and many places I
can visit. A tiny person in a tiny boat can sail all over the world
with a little skill and the patience to wait for a favorable wind.</p>

						<h1><a href="http://mikelevins.github.io/posts/2020-01-29-against-despair/">Against despair</a></h1>
						<span>Jan 29, 2020</span>
					</div>

					<p>Despair is a pernicious kind of vanity, and it&rsquo;s seductive when things
get hard.</p>
<p>Despair tells you a story like this: &ldquo;I have tried everything and it
hasn&rsquo;t worked. I may as well give up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This story is a lie.</p>
<p>When despair tells you &ldquo;it hasn&rsquo;t worked,&rdquo; it means that we have
falsely assumed that the world owes us a particular outcome for our
labors. It doesn&rsquo;t. The world promises one thing: the world
itself. Included in that world is our freedom of action and some
inherent capabilities. We are free to act, and we are free to choose
how to act. The world doesn&rsquo;t promise us any particular outcome for
our actions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It hasn&rsquo;t worked&rdquo; means we expected some specific outcome and didn&rsquo;t
get it. We&rsquo;re disappointed because we didn&rsquo;t get the value we expected
from the effort we expended, but that&rsquo;s because we&rsquo;re deriving value
from the wrong thing. The world does not promise us value in exchange
for effort. We can have it if we want, but the world doesn&rsquo;t supply
it. We have to do that ourselves.</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t reliably get it from outcomes, because outcomes aren&rsquo;t up to
us. Outcomes are like seasons and weather: they&rsquo;re given to us by the
whims of fortune (or, if you prefer, Providence). We don&rsquo;t choose
them.</p>
<p>What we can choose is where we get our value. If we want to get value
for effort, we have to derive it from something that is up to us—for
example, from the effort itself. We must choose to make efforts that
we value.</p>
<p>Just as &ldquo;it hasn&rsquo;t worked&rdquo; is a false story about where value comes
from, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve tried as hard as I can&rdquo; is a false story about our freedom
of action.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve tried as hard as I can&rdquo; sounds right when we&rsquo;re frustrated. It&rsquo;s
a lie, though. Despair tells us that there&rsquo;s nothing more we can do,
but despair doesn&rsquo;t know that. It&rsquo;s just pretending to know.</p>
<p>We may have tried everything we can think of, but that just means
we&rsquo;ve exhausted our knowledge and imagination for the moment. It
doesn&rsquo;t mean we&rsquo;ve exhausted our options. We always have options we
don&rsquo;t yet know about. Tomorrow we&rsquo;ll know things we don&rsquo;t know today.</p>
<p>Our efforts may have failed up to now, but tomorrow the world will be
different. We don&rsquo;t know what will change, but we can be sure that
something will. Nothing is more certain in life than change. Despair
whispers that nothing significant will be different, but it doesn&rsquo;t
know that, either. It&rsquo;s blowing smoke.</p>
<p>Despair is a liar. If you have a fanciful turn of mind you can think
of it as a demon. It comes to us when we&rsquo;re exhausted and frustrated
and offers a false promise of comfort. It says to us, &ldquo;There, there,
it&rsquo;s all right. There&rsquo;s nothing you can do, anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have to listen. We don&rsquo;t have to believe its lies. We can
recognize that we&rsquo;re exhausted and need to rest. We can give up for
the moment without giving up for good.</p>
<p>Despair wants us to promise that we won&rsquo;t try again, but we don&rsquo;t owe
it that. We don&rsquo;t owe it anything. We can rest and wait for our
strength to return. We can wait for change, for new understanding, for
help that we didn&rsquo;t expect.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re free to choose a different goal, perhaps a better one.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re free to choose what to value.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re free.</p>

						<h1><a href="http://mikelevins.github.io/posts/2020-01-24-amor-fati/">Amor Fati</a></h1>
						<span>Jan 24, 2020</span>
					</div>

					<p><em>Amor fati</em> is a Latin phrase that means &ldquo;love of fate.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s a
concept of virtue that we inherit from the ancient Stoics, though we
can probably thank Friedrich Nietzsche for the Latin phrase and for
its presence in modern discussion<!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="#f1">1</a><!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>The idea isn&rsquo;t original with Nietzsche. It appears in the writings of
Marcus Aurelius<!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="#f2">2</a><!-- raw HTML omitted -->—though not in so many words—and in
Epictetus<!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="#f3">3</a><!-- raw HTML omitted --> before him.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not obvious at first glance what it&rsquo;s supposed to mean. &ldquo;Love of
fate?&rdquo; Are we supposed to conceive of Fate as some sort of god and
worship it? Are we being asked to bow down to whatever random
occurrence comes along?</p>
<p>Not quite. The ancient Stoics regarded love of fate as a virtue, and I
agree, but I mean something particular by both <strong>love</strong> and <strong>fate</strong>.</p>
<p>By <strong>love</strong>, I mean caring for something, studying it, understanding
it, cultivating it. I mean a deliberate and purposeful act of
learning, nurturing, and improvement.</p>
<p>I do not mean a feeling of affection, or the moment of joy you might
derive from a pleasing experience. I don&rsquo;t mean a feeling at all.</p>
<p>A perfect example of this kind of love is caring for your
children. That labor may from time to time offer you a warm glow of
pleasure, and you might call that feeling &ldquo;love,&rdquo; but that&rsquo;s not what
I mean. I mean the care you take to nurture and cultivate your
children, regardless of how you feel about it in the moment. I mean
the choice that you deliberately make to care for them even when you
feel vexed and frustrated. That kind of love isn&rsquo;t about how you
feel. It&rsquo;s about what you choose to do. That kind of love is what
tells you that you&rsquo;re wrong when you let your feelings of vexation
dictate what you do.</p>
<p>That love is not a feeling; it&rsquo;s a deliberate course of action.</p>
<p>By <strong>fate</strong>, I mean the sum of your life from beginning to end. I mean
the situation into which you were born, the options offered to you by
fortune and circumstance, and the unfolding of all the consequences of
your choices, good and bad, foreseen and unforeseen. I mean, in terms
familiar to the ancient Romans and Greeks, the thread that the Fates
spin for you, the length of it that they measure, and the cut they
make that finally ends it.</p>
<p>I do not mean predestination or fortune.</p>
<p>Your fate in this sense is all that you are, and have been, and will
be. It includes everything you choose to be and do, and everything
that you don&rsquo;t. It&rsquo;s the circumstances that led to your birth, and the
situations you find yourself in. It&rsquo;s the choices you make and their
consequences, both foreseen and unforeseen. It&rsquo;s everything that is up
to you, and equally important, everything that isn&rsquo;t. It&rsquo;s all you
know of your existence, and all you don&rsquo;t, and everything you will
never know.</p>
<p>Love of fate means properly caring for the sum of your existence.</p>
<p>To love your fate means to see and understand that it&rsquo;s all that you
are, and have been, and will ever be. It&rsquo;s realizing that its care and
cultivation are in your hands and no one else&rsquo;s. It&rsquo;s resolving to
accept it as it is, understand it, and care for it just as you would a
loved one—not because it&rsquo;s without flaw, not because it&rsquo;s everything
you ever wanted, but because it&rsquo;s everything you <em>are</em>.</p>
<p>The reward for loving your fate is not something that you wait to
collect at the end. The reward is in the act of cultivation
itself. It&rsquo;s manifest in the care that you take in this moment and pay
forward to every moment that follows. In caring for your fate,
everything you give, you also receive. Once it&rsquo;s given, it&rsquo;s always
with you. You will never be without it again. Choose wisely.</p>
<p>Not loving our fate means that we make war upon it, upon
ourselves. Not learning ourselves, we cannot know how to properly care
for ourselves. We&rsquo;re as likely to harm ourselves as not. Not caring
for ourselves, we fall into suffering and delusion. We grow lost. We
rob ourselves of the cultivation that might have nurtured us. We lose
the opportunity to collaborate with a future self made stronger and
wiser by good care.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s sometimes hard to love your fate. No one&rsquo;s fate is all puppy dogs
and rainbows. Fortune offers us, not what we wish for, but a little
bit of this and a little bit of that, chosen according to its whims,
not ours. For every great job offer, there&rsquo;s a disaster in the
wings. For every accomplishment, a tragedy. In bad times it can be
hard to see past the suffering of the moment. A moment of good feeling
may be all we want, and we may be willing to do nearly anything to get
it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s fine, as far as it goes, but a good feeling is only a good
feeling. Like any feeling it comes and then it goes, and the whole
time you&rsquo;re right were you were to begin with. If you want something
better, you&rsquo;ll have to build it. It doesn&rsquo;t matter how bruised and
battered you are in the moment, if you want something better, you&rsquo;ll
have to cultivate it.</p>
<p>Your fate is endless—or it might as well be. It lasts as long as you
last, and when it ends, you end with it. You&rsquo;re always in it, whether
you pay attention to it or not. You can ignore it and wander from joy
to despair, at the mercy of fortune, or you can learn to love your
fate. You can acquaint yourself with it, come to know it, accept it,
care for it. You can nurture it and offer it to your future self. You
can accept that gift gratefully and pay it forward it again. You can
forge alliances with better future selves that will exist only if you
cultivate them now, and with all the alliances that those better
selves can make in turn.</p>
<p>But you have to care for your fate. You have to accept it for what it
is, and was, and will be. You have to learn it and understand it. You
have to love it, in the way that you love your children.</p>
