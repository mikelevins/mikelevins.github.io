      <description>Once in a while it comes up in conversation that I consider myself an anarchist. Most of the time when people learn that, they have one of three reactions:
 I&amp;rsquo;m kidding (or exaggerating, or engaging in some kind of hyperbole for effect) I&amp;rsquo;m serious, and crazy I&amp;rsquo;m serious, and they want to know what the heck I mean and how I can hold that position  Well, I&amp;rsquo;m not kidding, and as far as I know, I&amp;rsquo;m not crazy, so maybe I should say what I mean and how and why I hold the position I do.</description>

      <description>I was idly thinking about the GIFT, which comes up often for me because I not only surf the net, I also play networked games, where the theory plays out so often and so emphatically. I was also thinking about the things that people think are weird and foolish in other people, because I happen to be traveling this week, and those things vary somewhat from one place to another.</description>
